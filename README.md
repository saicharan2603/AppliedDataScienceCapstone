# SpaceX Falcon9 First Stage Successful Landing Prediction using Machine Learning
This project is focused on building a machine learning model to predict if the SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.

## Summary
* First stage accounts for 75% of total vehicle costs. Substantial savings of $27.5 million can be achieved through successful landings, elevating gross margin
from 40% to 77%. Demonstrated reusability with multi‑launch capabilities.
* Curated and analyzed data from diverse sources, employing API integration and web scraping (Beautiful Soup) for efficient data collection. Utilized SQL and
Matplotlib for Data Wrangling, EDA, and Feature Engineering, unveiling valuable insights.
* Engineered an Interactive Dashboard using Plotly Dash, providing an intuitive interface to explore launch records. Crafted a geographical map using Folium
to assess launch site proximity, enhancing decision‑making.
* Applied 5 distinct Machine Learning models including Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest to accurately predict launch out‑
comes. Summarized the project comprehensively through a professional PowerPoint presentation.
