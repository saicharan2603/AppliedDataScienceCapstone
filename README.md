# SpaceX Falcon9 First Stage Successful Landing Prediction using Machine Learning
This project is focused on building a machine learning model to predict if the SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.

## Summary
– First stage accounts for about 75 percent of the total vehicle cost. So A successful Landing saves approximately $27.5 million
and increases the gross margin from 40% to 77%, and the same rocket can be used for dozens of time or more.
– The Data was collected from an API and we did Web scraping from Wikipedia by using Beautiful Soup library.
– Did Data Wrangling and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL and Matplotlib to find some patterns in the
data and determine what would be the label for training supervised models, and performed Feature Engineering.
– Built an Interactive Dashboard to visualize/analyze launch records interactively with Plotly Dash. Then built an
interactive map to analyze the launch site proximity with Folium.
– Applied 5 Machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree and Random Forest
to predict if the launch will be successful or not. Also Submitted a PPT of my whole work
